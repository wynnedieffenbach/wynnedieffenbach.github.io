    <div class="header importanttextstyling5"> How I Made This </div>

    <p class="importanttextstyling6" style="background-color: rgb(247, 247, 114);"> This visualization was created in steps, the first of which I started weeks before the due date. I first found my running data from Strava. Then, after I figured out that I wanted to have a map be the main part of this project, I opened google maps
        and located the area in which we ran. I then created a vector map of the area and the route that we ran along in Adobe Illustrator. I then transferred this into photoshop to clean the map up a little bit, and create some other small graphics like
        the date that you see in the visualization. Then, I took the time to sketch out how I wanted all the elements to look together. Finally, I went into Indesign and began mapping out where I wanted stuff to go. I picked the format, type, color scheme,
        etc, and made it all work and fit nicely together.
