    <p class="importanttextstyling6"> In order to create this visualization, I first found my running data from Strava. Then, after I figured out that I wanted to have a map be the main part of this project, I opened google maps and located the area in which we ran. I then created a vector
        map of the area and the route that we ran along in Adobe Illustrator. It was very time consuming. Then, I used photoshop to clean the map up a little bit, and create some other small graphics like the date that you see in the visualization. Then,
        I took the time to sketch out how I wanted all the elements to look together. Finally, I went into Indesign and began mapping out where I wanted stuff to go. I picked the format, type, color scheme, etc, and made it all work and fit nicely together.
