        <p align="left" style="margin: 35px 75px 50px" style=font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif  > John Berger and BBCs Ways of Seeing addresses questions of how we, as humans, see the world, and how the world sees us in response. Focusing most specifically on the intersection of art and modern technology, Berger raises questions about what may happen if we change our <b> perspective</b> and typical way of seeing.

<h3 align="center" style="color:black" style="margin-block"> Thoughts</h3>
<p align="left" style="margin: 35px 75px 50px"> Berger spends a lot of time discussing how human gaze can be relayed through art. Traditional renaissance art affects societal standards of beauty and femininity. I found it interesting how womens depictions in European renaissance art reflects their daily struggles in a patriarchal society. 
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 35px 75px 50px">Through art, specifically the nude portrait, women experience a sense of a double consciousness. They are both objectified by the artist and gazed upon by male viewers, all while being unable to truly view themselves outside of societys perception of them. A woman is constantly taught to survey herself and is surrounded by her image. Thus, others perceptions on us affect how we see the world and ourselves.</p>
